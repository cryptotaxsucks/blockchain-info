        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Do I Need A Crypto Tax Software?</h2>
        <p>
          Crypto tax software platforms make it easy to do tax calculations and
          generate crypto tax reports. Many of them offer free plans so you can
          evaluate their tool and get started with calculating your
          cryptocurrency tax liability. They will pull all of your data from
          your crypto exchanges like Coinbase, pull your crypto transactions off
          the blockchains you use, and some have portfolio trackers for your
          crypto asset balances. Crypto tax software can help you abide by
          crypto tax laws, and some of them have good automations to help you
          label transactions to follow your country&apos;s tax rules.
          Cryptocurrency tax software will calculate your capital gains tax and
          income tax liabilities for you. You can download your crypto tax forms
          so you can either upload them to TurboTax, or provide them to your tax
          expert for inclusion in your tax return. Many also provide insights
          into tax loss harvesting. Their use definitely justifies the cost.

          Is Cryptocurrency Tax Software Accurate and Reliable?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency tax software is not accurate &quot;out of the
          box&quot;. It will require some manual reviews and editing to be
          accurate. Unfortunately, it is hard for these tax tools to keep up
          with the rapid innovation in crypto, so not all transactions can be
          automatically labeled. It is often useful to have a crypto tax
          professional like Crypto Tax Made Easy review your software for
          errors, and make sure you generate an accurate crypto tax report.
